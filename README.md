# Typescript-task-2-Simple-Number-Guessing-Game

This TypeScript code creates a class NumberGuessingGame which represents a simple number guessing game. It generates a random number within a specified range and allows the player to guess it within a certain number of attempts. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, informing them whether their guess was correct, too high, or too low. Finally, it declares the winner or informs the player if they have run out of attempts.
